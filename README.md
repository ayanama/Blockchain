# Blockchain
This is a blockchain-based ledger system, complete with a user-friendly web interface. This ledger allows partner banks to conduct financial transactions (to transfer money between senders and receivers) and to verify the integrity of the data in the ledger.

To use this application, enter a Sender and Receiver along with the transaction information, and click "Add Block". The "Add Block" button will record the transaction information to a blockchain based ledger system.

If you would like to see individual blocks, there is a drop-down menu on the left panel of the application that will allow you to specify which block you would like to see.

This application also has the ability to validate the blockchain using the "Validate Chain" button.
